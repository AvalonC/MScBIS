:::

Some web-enabled courses have registration restrictions which only allow students from particular level, major, or programme etc. to register the courses. Students who do not belong to those groups but wish to take the course should seek approval from the course-offering units via [the electronic form for add/drop of non-web-enabled courses](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/arro/content.asp?cid=156) during the last time-ticket.

If a course or section which is marked “only for College: CB” under the course section in the Master Class Schedule, it means the course section is restricted for students in College of Business to register.

Most of the courses are web-enabled courses which can be added/dropped on AIMS with the designated registration time-ticket (period) directly, if they can pass through the registration restrictions specified by course-offering academic units.

::: warning Rules
Students are not permitted to use any method to attempt to gain an unfair advantage during online course registration such as:

- holding a place on a course and then releasing it to a fellow student conspiratorially
- any attempt to add a course section that is known to be closed by using a computer program
- usage of any browser add-ons to monitor changes in section capacity which disrupts the web performance

Web activity will be continuously monitored during the add/drop period to safeguard the web performance.Students who misuse the course registration system will be barred from further usage of online add/drop of courses for the whole semester. Other appropriate disciplinary actions may also be taken against the students concerned.
